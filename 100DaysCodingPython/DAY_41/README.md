# Image Processes

# Introduction:

    Image processing is a fundamental task in computer vision and graphics, involving manipulation and analysis of digital images to extract useful information or enhance their visual appearance. This documentation provides an overview of image processing using Python's PIL (Python Imaging Library) module.

# Installation:

    Before you start with image processing, you need to ensure that the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module is installed. You can install it via pip using the following command:

`pip install Pillow`

# Image Conversion:

    The provided code demonstrates how to convert images from one format to another. It takes images from a specified input folder, converts them to PNG format, and saves the converted images to a specified output folder

# Usage

    Ensure that the PIL module is installed.
    Execute the provided Python script with appropriate command-line argument
    python3 jpg2png.py <input_folder> <output_folder>

    The input_folder -> contains your images to be converted
    output_folder -> empty folder for the converted images
